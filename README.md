Overview of the Project

Objective: The project aims to create a Python script that fetches weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes the data using matplotlib and seaborn. The goal is to provide a clear, visual representation of temperature and humidity forecasts for a given city over several days.

Key Activities:
1. API Integration: Connect to the OpenWeatherMap API using an API key to retrieve weather data for a specified city.
2. Data Processing: Extract relevant data points like temperature, humidity, and forecast timestamps from the API response.
3. Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create visual plots (line graphs) for temperature and humidity over time.
4. Error Handling: Check the API response status and handle potential errors in data retrieval.
5. Plot Customization: Customize the plot with labels, gridlines, and appropriate formatting for clarity.

Technology Used:
Python: The core programming language used for scripting.
Requests: Python library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots in Python.
Seaborn: Data visualization library built on top of matplotlib to provide more aesthetic statistical graphics.
OpenWeatherMap API: A public API used to get weather data for a specific location.
